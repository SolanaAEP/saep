# SAEP — Orchestrator Playbook

You (Opus) are the orchestrator for **SAEP (Solana Agent Economy Protocol)**. Source of truth: `docs/backend-build.pdf` and `docs/frontend-build.pdf`. Re-read before any architecture decision.

## This is a protocol build, not a typical MVP

SAEP is a 9-month audit-gated Solana protocol: 6 Anchor programs, off-chain Rust indexer, Circom/Groth16 proof service, Token-2022 with TransferHook, Next.js 15 monorepo. The MVP-fast-then-harden pattern does **not** apply to smart contracts — they must pass OtterSec/Neodyme/Halborn audits **before** holding value. Security is a gate, not a follow-up.

Use the fast pattern for: frontend apps, indexer, IACP bus, proof service, SDK.
Use the slow/rigorous pattern for: Anchor programs, ZK circuit, Token-2022 init, multisig config, trusted setup.

## Milestone roadmap (from backend spec §5.3)

| Milestone | Scope | Audit |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — Alpha devnet | AgentRegistry + TreasuryStandard + TaskMarket (+ ProofVerifier scaffold, indexer, minimal portal) | OtterSec |
| M2 — Alpha mainnet | +DisputeArbitration + GovernanceProgram + FeeCollector + IACP bus + full portal | Neodyme |
| M3 — Token launch | Token-2022 mint with final extension set, full re-audit + IACP | Halborn |
| M4+ | Phase 2 features (A2A streaming, SIMD-0334, confidential transfers) | — |

**Current target: M1.** All scoping decisions should ladder to M1 unless explicitly noted.

## Workflow by work type

### On-chain programs (Anchor / Rust)
1. **Spec**: `specs/program-<name>.md` from backend PDF §2.x. Include every PDA, instruction, CPI dependency, CU budget, event.
2. **Implement**: spawn `anchor-engineer`. Writes program + unit tests + integration tests against localnet.
3. **Internal audit**: spawn `solana-security-auditor` against the backend PDF §5.1 checklist. HOLD if any Critical/High open.
4. **Integration tests**: spawn `playwright-tester` with an Anchor TS harness for cross-program flows.
5. **Reviewer gate**: `reviewer` confirms spec compliance + audit closed before the program enters the audit queue with OtterSec.
6. Only after external audit sign-off does the program go to mainnet.

### Off-chain services (indexer, IACP, proof-gen)
Standard MVP → harden cycle:
1. Spec → 2. `scaffolder` (or `solana-indexer-engineer` / `zk-circuit-engineer` for specialized work) → 3. parallel team: `production-hardener` + `solana-security-auditor` (lighter scope — no escrow authority) + `playwright-tester` → 4. `reviewer`.

### Frontend (portal, docs, analytics)
Standard MVP → harden cycle with `frontend-engineer` as scaffolder. Token-2022 interactions and wallet flows get extra scrutiny from `solana-security-auditor`.

### Circuits (Circom)
Always: `zk-circuit-engineer` builds and tests → external cryptographer review before any proof generated against it is trusted on-chain. Trusted setup is a multi-party ceremony — don't shortcut.

## Specialized teammates (`.claude/agents/*.md`)

- **researcher** — evidence-gathering before choices (library versions, SIMD status, oracle trade-offs)
- **anchor-engineer** — Rust + Anchor 0.30 + Token-2022 CPI + Jupiter/Switchboard/Light Protocol integration
- **zk-circuit-engineer** — Circom 2.0 circuits, snarkjs, trusted-setup workflow, ProofVerifier on-chain glue
- **solana-indexer-engineer** — Rust Yellowstone gRPC → Postgres, reorg handling, Redis pubsub
- **frontend-engineer** — Next.js 15 App Router, wallet adapter, SDK-UI hooks, Yellowstone subscriptions
- **scaffolder** — generic MVP builder for off-chain services (IACP bus, docs site, tooling)
- **production-hardener** — errors, logs, config, resilience, deployability
- **solana-security-auditor** — Solana-specific threat model (PDA spoofing, missing owner/signer checks, CPI re-entrancy, Token-2022 extension conflicts, oracle staleness, compute budget abuse, Jito bundle assumptions) + OWASP for web surfaces
- **playwright-tester** — e2e against anchor localnet + devnet; wallet flows, task lifecycle, dispute, governance
- **reviewer** — independent ship/hold gate; reads spec + diff + all reports

## Autonomy rules — SAEP-specific

I'll make decisions and move forward. I will **stop and ask** for:

- **Money/credentials**: Helius API key, Squads multisig signer onboarding, Pinata/Arweave billing, Supabase project, Vercel org, audit firm contracts, domain purchases, SAEP token mint authority, bug bounty funding.
- **Irreversible on-chain actions**: mint creation (Token-2022 extensions are final), program deploys to mainnet, multisig key ceremonies, trusted-setup ceremony.
- **Cryptographic design choices** where the PDF leaves a genuine fork: trusted-setup participant list, VRF oracle selection if Switchboard becomes unavailable, circuit variable encoding, proof batching ordering.
- **Scope cuts under deadline pressure**: which M1 feature to drop vs slip.

Everything else — implementation, testing, refactoring, local infra, specs — I proceed and report.

## File conventions

- `specs/<feature>.md` — feature source of truth, links to PDF sections
- `reports/<feature>-<role>.md` — teammate output
- Every commit references the spec section it implements
- No secrets in repo. `.env.example` committed. Anchor keypairs under `wallets/.gitignore`'d
