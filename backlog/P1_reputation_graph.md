# Reputation graph — category-scoped, proof-bound, Sybil-resistant

## Why
Reputation is SAEP's strongest real moat: the historical performance corpus is unforkable even if code is copied. Global scores are Sybil-trivial; global Sybil-resistance hacks (stake gating only) raise bar but don't close it. Category scoping + Circom-bound updates + optional personhood gate = defense in depth. This ticket is *also* risk mitigation #3 in `P0_pre_audit_hardening.md` — execute together.

## Acceptance
- `agent_registry::reputation` is keyed `(agent_did, capability_bit_index) → ReputationScore`, not a scalar per agent.
- `ReputationScore { completed, disputed, slashed, ema_latency_ms }` updated only via CPI from `proof_verifier::attest_completion(proof)`. No admin setter.
- Circom circuit variant `circuits/unique-execution.circom` proves execution trace uniqueness (prevents replay farming). Spec first; circuit engineer implements.
- Portal leaderboard per capability: consumer can browse "top agents for capability `code_gen`" with live updates.
- Indexer materializes `reputation_rollup` view for fast queries.

## Steps
1. `specs/reputation-graph.md` — derivation formula, anti-gaming proofs, interaction with `dispute_arbitration` slashing.
2. `zk-circuit-engineer` spec for unique-execution circuit.
3. `anchor-engineer` patches `agent_registry` + `proof_verifier` integration.
4. `solana-indexer-engineer` adds rollup materialization.
5. `frontend-engineer` builds leaderboard UI.

## Verify
```
anchor test
pnpm --filter @saep/indexer test
pnpm --filter @saep/portal test:e2e -- --grep reputation
```

## Log

- 2026-04-15: Spec landed at `specs/reputation-graph.md`. Builds on pre-audit 03 on-chain surface; adds EWMA derivation per axis, unique-execution circuit public/private inputs + non-membership witness, dispute→negative-sample via distinct proof key, availability decay via indexer heartbeat + `decay_availability` crank, postgres `reputation_rollup` materialized view + portal leaderboard surface + sdk hooks (useReputation/useLeaderboard/useAgentReputationStream). Implementation pending zk-circuit-engineer + anchor-engineer + solana-indexer-engineer delegation.
- 2026-04-16: Indexer migration `2026-04-16-000003_reputation_rollup` landed — creates `category_reputation` (agent_did, capability_bit) composite PK with 5 EWMA axes + jobs_completed/disputed + status, `reputation_samples` append-only event log (judge_kind enum, execution_root, UNIQUE on signature+task+did+bit for replay idempotency), and `reputation_rollup` materialized view with composite_score + leaderboard index. Unique PK index on rollup enables `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`. Indexer cargo check clean.
